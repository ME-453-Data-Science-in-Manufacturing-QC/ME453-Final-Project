Automated structure quality monitoring for two-photon  lithography

• Background:
Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an additive manufacturing technique to produce three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nanostructures.
One challenge in TPL lies in the identification of optimal process parameters such as the laser power and the scanning rate. Different process parameters lead to different structure quality. 

• Objective: 
To automatically identify the quality of printed structures.
Using computer vision techniques to build a multiclass classifier
Implement a sliding-window algorithm to locate damaged structures in a image

• Data source: NSF Project “A Digital Manufacturing Platform to Democratize Biological Tissue Access Using Smart Two-Photon Polymerization”
• Data from four quality classes
Uncured : 24 images
Good : 625 images
Partially damaged: 150 images
Severely damaged: 375 images
